# JavaScript practice/projects
This folder contains all of my small JS practice projects. I am using this folder as a way to organize my smaller JS projects so that I can improve and better understand JS. This folder will only contain small JS projects and the sole focus will be working on JS, so it is not meant to be a fully complete websites with HTML and CSS.
